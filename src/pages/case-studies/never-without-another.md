challenge: the challenge.
challengeOne: having a background in psychology, i've always understood the importance of mental health and sought ways to improve my own well-being. with my pivot into the tech space, i realised that i now had the capacity to develop a solution that has the potential to help those whom are suffering from loneliness or depression. 
challengeTwo: the objective of never without another is simple; help those in need realise that the loneliness or transgressions they're suffering from is not something they need to go through alone.

solution: the solution.
solutionOne: never without another is a daily journaling application; a rather simple solution to a very complicated, and most of the time abstract problem. though the concept is rather simple, there are a few factors that make never without another rather special.
solutionTwo: with the ohjective of one day developing this application into a fleshed out solution, i cannot disclose the ideas and methodologies behind the solutions. though i can guarantee that they are based off of empirically and scientifically supported data.
